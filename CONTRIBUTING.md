# How to contribute

Here's the common process to contribute in a github project !

- **Fork** the repository in your own account

- Create a **Pull Request** with your contribution (you must integrate a CI to test the code when a pull request is open)

- Post a message in the **Pull Request** to describe what your contribution does.
